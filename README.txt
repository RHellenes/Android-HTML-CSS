HTML + CSS drawing
 android. html is a drawing project, where I use HTML and CSS to draw a picture of Android in space. 
I made the android based on this tutorial: http://thecodeplayer.com/walkthrough/css3-android-logo .
THis started the project as I thought it stood all alone there.

Later I might look in to adding jQuery to make it more interactive. 

I do not have a end result in which I would like to accomplish, this is rather a project where I 
add when I want to add an effect or an object. This is a never ending project.
